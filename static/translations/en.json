For instance, if the student struggles with adding algebraic fractions, we can tackle it in several ways. First, we might use simple fractions with prime denominators: \\[ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{3} \\]. If the student progresses, we can move to more complex ones requiring LCM, like \\[ \\frac{5}{12} - \\frac{7}{18} \\]. If they still can’t solve them, we might go back to the first example but use a visual approach like a cake diagram. The goal when a student doesn’t understand something is to reframe the question, not treat the student as slow.",
